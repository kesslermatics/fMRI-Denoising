**FAU lecture on MRI (for getting solid core understanding of how the data is generated):**

**General overview paper (of rather old approaches for denoising):**

**Cleaning the BOLD fMRI signal:**

(Talks also about where noise comes from in the fMRI process and specifically in the BOLD signal, which is exactly what we are working with. So maybe good starting point for artificial noising strategy and classical denoising preprocessing techniques - also mentions some .py files but I have not looked at them yet.)
