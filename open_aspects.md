# Open Aspects

## Artificial noising
- Just use the standard level of gaussian noise configured in the notebook? Answer: We can vary that and try different levels too

## Dataset
- All .nii.gz files from all subfolders? Yes all in the func subfolders (and anat is a high resolution hopefully coregistered scan that could be used as additional information for denoising possibly )

## Modeling
- Only one model for next presentation but later multiple possible right? -> Pretty flexible and how many and can also change later
- Should we also validate how classification improves after denoising at the end or not? (And if so with what labels?) -> Maybe at the end, but we will get more information on that then
